This file describe what have changed in this playbook version:

- Removed all the tags
- All variables are now in site.yml
- The firewall rule are handled in the common role (with UFW)
- Java is now deployed on each machine before further installation
- Ports and ip address are now user choice (variables)
- 'remote_user' is remplaced by 'ansible_user'
- removed all obsolet 'sudo:' command and use 'become'
- Add various custom patterns and grocks


Still not suported:
- ELK stacks/multiple nodes
- So far only ubuntu 16.04LTS is supported
- Logstash log file creation in the host machine # TO CHECK

TODO :
- It is impossible now to install the stack on a single machine. Need to add conditional variable to do it.
- site.yml is hudge, may be split it ?
- Make a role to delete everything - DO U EVEN READ IT ? EVERYTHING

Reported bugs:
- Time to time the file kibana.yml is not created during the installation in : /opt/kibana/config
You may need to resinstall manually this file or relaunch the ansible role.


U need the last version of ansible:
