This file describe what have changed in this playbook version:

- Removed all the tags
- All variables are now in site.yml
- The firewall rule are handled in the common role (with UFW)
- Java is now deployed on each machine before further installation
- Ports and ip address are now user choice (variables)
- 'remote_user' is remplaced by 'ansible_user'
- removed all obsolet 'sudo:' command and use 'become'
- Add various custom patterns and grocks


Still not suported:
- ELK stacks/multiple nodes
- So far only ubuntu 16.04LTS is supported
- Logstash log file creation in the host machine # TO CHECK

TODO :
- It is impossible now to install the stack on a single machine. Need to add conditional variable to do it.
- site.yml is hudge, may be split it ?
- Make a role to delete everything - DO U EVEN READ IT ? EVERYTHING

Reported bugs:
- Time to time the file kibana.yml is not created during the installation in : /opt/kibana/config
You may need to resinstall manually this file or relaunch the ansible role.

TODO:
Ideas who came during the creation of patterns and grocks :
- Create a pattern dir "/etc/logstash/patterns.d/"
- Open the ports in UFW
- In logstash/src/* add ansible variables fort port numbers and equipement names
- See if in logstash output is required in each file or we can put it once in 99-output.conf
- Start logstash at startup
- Rename the grock SYSLOGASA in something more appropriate
- Faire un if qui verifie que la version d'ansible >= 2.1

Edit the following files to modify memory and file number limits. These instructions assume Ubuntu 10.04, may work on later versions and other distributions/OSes.

/etc/security/limits.conf:
elasticsearch - nofile 65535
elasticsearch - memlock unlimited

/etc/default/elasticsearch:
ES_HEAP_SIZE=512m
MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535
MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml:
bootstrap.mlockall: true

You need the last version of ansible:

pip install ansible==2.1
