TODO:
Ideas who came during the creation of patterns and grocks :

- Create a pattern dir "/etc/logstash/patterns.d/"
- Open the ports in UFW
- In logstash/src/* add ansible variables fort port numbers and equipement names
- See if in logstash output is required in each file or we can put it once in 99-output.conf
